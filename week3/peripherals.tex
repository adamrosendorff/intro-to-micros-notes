\chapter{Perihperals}
%Ports are typically controlled by a block of memory called perihperals. Unlike RAM which is general purpose, each register in the perihperals memory block has a specific, well defined purpose. Typically the purpose of these perihperal registes are for configuring the microcontroller to behave in a certain way or communicate with the outside world.
%These CPU registers are different to the peripheral registers mentioned earlier for the reasons that they are located inside the CPU rather than in the address space and also they are mostly general purpose: they can hold any data required in the execution of a program.
